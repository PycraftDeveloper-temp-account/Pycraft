Pycraft is an OpenGL, OpenWorld, Video Game made entirely with Python. This project is a test to shed some light on OpenGL programming in Python as it is a seldom touched area of Python's vast amount of uses. Feel free to give this project a run, and message me if you have any feedback! <br />
Made with Python 64-bit and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

_Please note; all previous versions of Pycraft, with the exception of the most recent, have been moved to the releases section; Please consult the releases section of this README for more information_

## Pycraft's Sound Files - Preview 1

There is a lot of progress still to be made in creating all the sound files for Pycraft, but here are some early previews, as well as a description of where they will likely appear (likely subject to change). These are all open-source and free for anyone else to take and use in their projects too! Also there are a few issues with this page and it will be taken down between the 14/01/2022 and 17/01/2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) for small maintenance (some file renaming and restructuring and a few additional sounds)

### Ancient Fountain Theme
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644536-aaf0e70f-c2ac-453c-8749-36b2fbce7032.mp4

This sound will play at special fountains in the game, these fountains are where 8 individual spirits lie, they are very special/powerful places with good views of the surrounding land, this sound will play at these places of significance and others around the map.

### Battle Theme
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644537-6da07dce-04ea-4fca-a777-4be91c3b74ae.mp4

This sound will play when fighting enemies in game, this does not apply to 'boss' mobs which will have their own individual sound, some of which have been created below.

### Boss/Dungeon Theme 1-3

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644538-2c05586b-d5de-4221-9b21-f15e196bee7c.mp4

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644540-bda008d9-b5f0-43d3-a3c4-3de0997243ba.mp4

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644548-605fe475-9d72-4f79-bbbc-c665bf017fd6.mp4

These sounds will play when fighting a specific 'boss' enemy, each of the bosses will have their own respective dungeon and sounds, none of the 'bosses' have been created or planned yet so these sound files has not been assigned to a 'boss' or dungeon as yet.

### Castle Theme

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644542-d3172a24-068a-49ff-bdd2-4318864864fe.mp4

This sound will play when you are inside the castle, this sound does not play in the castle grounds, another sound will be created for that. This sound is also not specific to set areas of the castle.

### Dark Forces Gain Power 1-2

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644543-d0e2337e-4e0e-4adf-a8da-d15521961422.mp4

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644544-924d5fc4-1c3a-4efe-b9e2-552edc5ce88b.mp4

These sounds will play when the player has reached certain milestones in the 'main quest' section of the game where the dark forces (basic enemies as well as bigger bosses) awaken/grow in power.

### Dark Forces Invade the Castle

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644546-7d560be5-efed-4390-a73d-ea6c3a137c26.mp4

This sound plays at the biggest climax of the story, the enemies have invaded the village (a separate sound below for that) and the player has been trapped in a dungeon, they need to get out as a fight ensues in the castle between the 'good' and 'evil' forces. (In the end the user makes it out of the dungeon and is guided to the fight by the spirits (bodies of good in the game) and together they manage to destroy hordes of enemies and a final 'boss').

### Finding Friends / Side-quest Completion

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644550-4d1e3bbc-f7d0-4fea-9897-128614f2fd1f.mp4

This sound is more positive and is used to mark an end to a user's optional 'side-quest'.

### Forest Theme

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644551-6f6cdce3-53f6-4b77-a91a-2df8fabec1c2.mp4

This sound plays when the user is within the Forest of Secrets, this area is very foggy and the user needs to move quickly to get through the fog, if they stop for more than a few seconds the fog around them will thicken and they will be moved to a different nearby location to confuse them. Should they get to the centre there is an enemy base guarding one of the fountains, there is no fog in this clearing. There is an area of dense forest/jungle that surrounds this area, that acts as a barrier for the user, this area is filed with enemies and the NPCs in the village will show evident fear of that place. No large area of the game will be off-limits to the user, but there will be a progression in the difficulty of enemies in later game places.

### In Contact with Spirits

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644552-6089d274-9449-4655-99c5-06463eb63091.mp4

This sound will play when the user has entered one of 8 in-game fountains, they can do this by throwing in a symbolic item (for example, the 'air' spirit will accept a 'rare bird feather' to activate the fountain) these items will be clearly marked at the top of the fountain, but not 'filled-in' until the user throws in a symbolic item, when they do this they are transported to a dungeon, there are 8 in total and the user can leave and re-enter at any time, but the dungeon will re-set it's self unless the user reaches special 'check-points', once the dungeon is complete a final room will open and the player will hear this music, in that room there will be one of the 8 spirits which will award you for your toil and then disappear, this is one of the only times you see the spirit in a physical form, but they exist above the fountain casting a beam of light into the sky.

### Loss Theme

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644553-2b557d5b-5b30-4c10-baf8-7251aab375de.mp4

This sound will play at the loss of any NPC in the game, there are only a few times this happens. This also plays at sad points in the game.

### Milestone Reached

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644559-42398c1a-21f2-42a5-92db-c2d820fff9c7.mp4

This is one of the most positive sounds in the game, and also one of the least occurring and hardest to get access to. This sound plays after the completion of any dungeon, the defeat of any boss mob, the completion of all side-quests as well as a few more undecided moments.

### Realisation

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644562-bcd0b1d1-e41d-4ce1-bedc-801ca9e3c1c1.mp4

The use of this sound is not as defined as others in this list, but this will likely play at the completion of achievements, side quests or at other points in-game.

### Smugglerâ€™s theme

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644563-c646898f-6a82-462b-8f77-5bc2977cc7fd.mp4

This plays when you are on the boat going towards Pycraft, this is where you learn some of the basic game mechanics and the plot begins. This also plays at a place called 'Smuggler's Cave' which is located below the jungle in a cliff, this is a large enemy hideout and this is where the enemies collect their food from (other than stealing and hunting), you are asked for one of the side-quests to check out the place and discover this, then you will go back to the castle and report the crime for a reward. This sound plays when there are any smuggler's boats around or when you are in the cave or have line of sight and are nearby.

### Laboratory theme

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148646360-1e424f5f-78db-48b4-bd16-e7578d256b91.mp4

This only plays in a few locations throughout the game, this plays at the castle's laboratory as well as at some of the shops in the game.


### Success Theme

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644564-37d51dcb-8679-4917-a69c-309cb9ded8c4.mp4

This sound will play at special moments in the game, when 'bosses' are defeated and this is one of the last sounds you hear at the end of the game. This is also a sound that occurs in 'recounts' of the last victory against 'evil' which you learn about as the plot progresses. This sound will likely get more use as the game is developed.

### Cave Theme / Dungeon Theme / Tales of Sadness

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644565-77e3ba80-1a6e-4ba4-8671-c621e8d42785.mp4

This sound will play when the user is in the smuggler's cave to contrast the use of 'smugglers theme', this sound will also likely feature in one of the dungeons as well as at sad moments in the game. This sound is more of a work-in-progress than others.

### The Castle is in Danger

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644567-79ffedc7-a56e-4705-9be0-885a067da8b8.mp4

This sound plays when the king (or queen, this option may be left up to the player in 'character-designerâ€™) and his officials and army realise that there is a battle approaching, this sound plays as the castle is readied for the battle  and there is widespread panic in the villages. This does not play during the battle.

### Village Theme 1-3

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644568-d331e323-2436-48af-ad62-38d1a5f7f24d.mp4

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644570-e7394823-336f-4e36-bb55-ce80bd0e95a7.mp4

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81379254/148644571-e0bf583e-fb06-4c91-bbb2-1b1c1209c2ea.mp4

These three sounds have been created for each of the 4 villages that are in the game (with one sound not finished). The first sound is for the main village, this is where the main plot begins, but the other three are discovered later, contact blocked by the 'evil' forces at play. The player will receive rewards for creating contact with these villages and this is part of the main quest, these villages will contain related side-quests.
