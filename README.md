## About
Pycraft is a 3D open-source, open-world video game made in Python. For a long time attempts to make large 3D games in Python have been ignored, we believe there are two reasons: one; People use Python primarily for data handling and processing and not graphics and, two; there is little to no documentation out there to do anything more than make a 3D rotating cube in Python. Making a 3D game in Python for us hasn't been an easy experience, far from it but we have decided to share my project, complete with tutorials, explanations, articles and code explanations in the hope that 3D game development in Python can be seen as a more easily attainable target, and to fill that gap in documentation. Pycraft then is a trial project, as we learn and experiment on what goes best where and how thing go together, this is why development can sometimes appear to have stopped, because we are learning and testing what we have learned, so hopefully for people in the future it will be an easier experience. Also, don't forget there is more to game development than just graphics, there is AI, sound, physics and all the other GUIs that go with it, and as we learn the quality of the overall program will improve. Pycraft is not going to be the final name of the game, however until something better becomes available, we shall stick to it.

## Setup
### Installing the project from GitHub (Method 1)
The project will download as a (.zip) compressed file. Please make sure you have the project decompressed before use. Next make sure that any folders and files outside of the 'Pycraft' folder are removed and that the 'Pycraft' file is in the intended place for the file to be run from. This file can be freely moved around, transported between drives, computers and folders in this form!

_Just make sure that if you plan to use the installer that you make sure the file location is correct after you have moved the project, to do this simply remove everything in the 'pycraft/Data_Files/InstallerConfig.json' file and re-load the game, it will try to repair the file and write the new path instead, during this process it may appear that Pycraft has crashed as it will likely bring up an error message, a more user-friendly experience is coming soon__

When running the program please make sure you have a minimum of 1GB of free space on the drive and also have Python 3.7 or above installed on your device. This can be found here: (www.python.org/downloads). The version of Python isn't too important in this circumstance however the project has been tested in Python 3.7 and above and is known to work. In addition to all this please make sure you have the following modules installed on your device:

Pygame, Numpy, Pillow, PyAutoGUI, Psutil, PyWaveFront, CPUinfo, Ctypes, ModernGL, ModernGL_Window, GPUtil, Pyrr, PyJoystick, Noise and Matplotlib.

For those not familiar they can be found here: (pypi.org).

You can use the following syntax to install, update and remove these modules:

``pip install <module>``
``pip uninstall <module>``

Here is a short video tutorial walk you through all this: (https://youtu.be/DG5YbE-umw0)

### Installing the project from GitHub (Method 2)
If you are installing the project from the GitHub releases page or through Source Forge, then this will be relevant for you.
After you have selected your preferred file type (it'll be either a compiled (.exe) file or a (.zip) file, those that download the (.zip) file will find the information above more relevant.

If you, however, download the (.exe) type file, then this will be more relevant for you. If you locate the file in your file explorer and double click it, then this will run the project. You do not need Python, or any of the projects required modules, as they come built-in with this method. This method does also not install anything extra to your devise, to remove the project, simply delete the (.exe) file in your file explorer. Please note that it can take a few moments for everything in the (.exe) file to load and initialise, so nothing might not appear to happen at first. Also, you can only run one instance of Pycraft at any time (even if you are using another method).

### Installing from PyPi (preferred)
If you are installing the project from PyPi, then you will need an up-to-date build of Python (3.7 or greater ideally) and also permission to install additional files to your device. Then you need to open a command-line interface (or CLI), we recommend Terminal on Apple based devises, and Command Prompt on Windows based machines. You install the latest version of Pycraft, and all its needed files though this command:

``pip install Python-Pycraft``

and you can also uninstall the project using the command:

``pip uninstall Python-Pycraft``

And now you can run the project as normal.
Please note that at present it can be a bit tricky to locate the files that have downloaded, you can import the project into another python file using:

``import Pycraft``

### Installing using Pipenv
You can alternatively run these commands in the directory containing a file called `Pipfile`:

``pip install pipenv`` then: ``pipenv install python-pycraft``

And to start the game: ``pipenv run python <PATH to 'main.py'>``

## Running The Program
When running the program, you will either have a (.exe) file, downloaded from the releases page, or you will have the developer preview, if you have the developer preview, which can be found in the files section of this repository then this is how you run that program.

Now you have the program properly installed hopefully (you'll find out if you haven't promptly!) you need to locate and run the file "main.py" if it crashes on your first run then chances are you haven't installed the program correctly, if it still doesn't work then you can contact us. We do hope however that it works alright for you and you have a pleasant experience. This program has been developed on a Windows 64-bit computer however should run fine on a 32-bit Windows machine (uncompiled) or through MacOS although they remain untested for now. 

We recommend creating a shortcut for the "main.py" file too so it's easier to locate.

## Uncompiled Pycraft Dependencies
When you're installing the uncompiled Pycraft variant from here you need to install the following 'modules', which can be done through your Control Panel in Windows (First; press <windows key + r> then type "cmd" then run the below syntax) or on Apple systems in Terminal.

```
pip install <module>
pip uninstall <module>
```
pip is usually installed by default when installing Python with most versions.

- PIL (Pillow or Python Imaging Library) @ www.github.com/python-pillow/Pillow <br />
- Pygame @ www.github.com/pygame/pygame <br />
- Numpy @ www.github.com/numpy/numpy <br />
- PyAutoGUI @ www.github.com/asweigart/pyautogui <br />

- Matplotlib @ www.github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib <br />

_Disclaimer; unfortunately, lots of these python modules (first and third party) can require some external modules that will be installed during the installing process of the above modules, unfortunately this makes it really difficult to give credit to those modules, if you have any recommendations, please contact me appropriately._

## Changes
Pycraft v9.5.4 is now live! Here is a list of all the added features to this minor update: <br />

* Feature: This update marks the completion of the majority of the settings menu, including the expansion of the core concept first looked at in Pycraft v0.9.6-2.0 with a new area to specify keyboard inputs, as well as the filling out of other categories. There is now an expanded developer menu and a new place under "storage and permissions" where you can view how much storage Pycraft is using and a breakdown of what makes up that percentage.

* Feature: This update marks the start of a big transition away from using the default ModernGL-Window module for our windowing needs, and switching back to Pygame, huge sections of the game engine are - or are in the process of being rewritten to continue this transition.

* Bug-Fix: A huge number of bugs have been fixed, with both the settings menu and with the game engine its self, and more bugs will continue to be fixed as we continue to work on the new game engine and tweaking Pycraft's structure.

Again, feedback would be much appreciated this update was released on; 16/09/2022 (UK date; DD/MM/YYYY). As always, we hope you enjoy this new release and feel free to leave feedback.

_Notice: This update includes many huge changes and additions to Pycraft, but is also not in its most stable condition, this is meant more as a proof of concept rather than a better laid out developer update, you are welcome to use the latest code, but all of the developer update related warnings definitely apply here as we continue to fine tune some features_

_Notice: Unfortunately, due to the nature of some of these changes, some areas are not yet accessible, and this version of Pycraft is already around 4 days old so doesn’t include some of the more recent changes to Pycraft as heard in our progress updates on Twitter. A List of all the features not making it into Pycraft v0.9.6-2.5's update include:_
* _The new controller events system redesign - for both 2D and 3D GUIs_
* _The Inventory GUI_
* _The Map GUI_
* _Translations throughout Pycraft with customisation from the settings menu_
* _The ability to adjust Pycraft's rendering resolution, FOV adjustments in game and the ability to compile maths related functions_
* _The new load screen_

## Understanding the release notes
This section will hopefully provide additional information on helping to read the release notes. Points detailed after the "Feature" tag are what was focused on in the update and will likely always be present in each update, often this is the most significant area of the update. Points detailed after the "Bug-Fix" tag are likely to be the most frequent, they outline the most major bugs that have been fixed in this update, although they are not the only bugs that have been fixed. Points detailed after the "Performance" tag are used where there have been significant performance improvements to the project. Points detailed after the "Identified-Bugs" tag are bugs that have been identified in the project and that haven't been fixed as of writing the release notes, these are significant issues and will be fixed as soon as possible. Points detailed after the final "Documentation" tag are indicators of significant improvements to the documentation. The "PEP8" tag is used to signify that significant changes have been made to Pycraft to bring it in line with the PEP8 standards.

## Input mapping
This section will be replaced with a dedicated file for keymapping as well as an in-game guide when this area of Pycraft is completed.
### Keyboard

* Use W, A, S, D in game to move around, and use these keys in the map GUI to move that around.
* Use SPACE to jump in game, reset your zoom in the map GUI, start the benchmark section, or press 10 times to enter Devmode.
* Use E in game to access your inventory
* Use R in game to access the map
* Use F11 to toggle full-screen
* Use Q to access a resource value screen
* Use L in game to toggle locking your mouse (forcing it to stay in the window or not)
* Use X to exit Devmode

### Mouse

* SCROLL in the map to zoom in/out, or to scroll the settings menu
* LEFT CLICK to select

_A detailed map of inputs for keyboard and mouse or controller combinations is coming; for now, see the section below, toggling between full-screen is currently not bound to a button on the controller because we will need all the different buttons for gameplay_

## Our Update Policy
New releases will be introduced regularly, it is likely that there will be some form of error or bug, therefore unless you intend to use this project for development and feedback purposes (Thank you all!) we recommend you use the latest stable release; below is how to identify the stable releases.

## Version Naming
Pycraft's naming system consists of at least 3 numbers. The first number signifies if the project is in a finished state. The second number relates to the number of significant updates Pycraft has had. The third number relates to smaller sub-updates, these updates are usually used to show progress towards larger releases.

Each time an update is released that changes any of the first 3 numbers, a release is added here on GitHub, on PyPi and on SourceForge, and will be able to be downloaded in either raw (.py) python files, or compiled into a (.exe) format for better ease of use.

In addition to the first 3 numbers, there may also be two additional numbers. The first is separated by another point at the end of the version and is used to signify very minor adjustments to a release. These are very rarely used. More commonly however is the final number separated by a hyphen ("-"), this is used to indicate progress towards a sub-update, otherwise known as developer releases these indicate progress towards a release and are used to break up bigger updates. These are often buggy and showcase experimental features.

### Examples
These are not real-world examples and have been made up for the purpose of demonstration
- Pycraft v0.9.6: This is not Pycraft in its finished state, however it is the 9th big update to Pycraft, and is the 6th update towards Pycraft v0.10.0
- Pycraft v0.9.6.1: This is also not Pycraft in its finished state, however it is the 9th big update to Pycraft, and is the 6th update towards Pycraft v0.10.0. It is also the second minor release of Pycraft v0.9.6 and likely fixes game breaking bugs.
- Pycraft v0.9.6-3: This is not Pycraft in its finished state, however it is the 9th big update to Pycraft, and is the 6th update towards Pycraft v0.10.0. It is also the 3rd developer update towards Pycraft v0.9.7.

A better system will be added soon; we will use 3 digits to represent the version of Pycraft.
- The first digit will be used to represent the current build update to Pycraft
- The second digit will be used to represent a smaller improvement
- The third digit will be used for either developer updates or for patches

This means that Pycraft v0.9.6.0-3 will become Pycraft v9.5.4! These changes take effect from the 24/10/2022 (DD/MM/YYYY)

## Releases
All past versions of Pycraft are available under the releases section of Pycraft, this is a new change, but just as before, major releases like Pycraft v0.9 and Pycraft v0.8 will have (.exe) releases, but smaller sub-releases will not, this is in light of a change coming to Pycraft, this should help with the confusion behind releases, and be more accommodating to the installer that's being worked on as a part of Pycraft v0.9.4. This brings me on to another point, all past updates to Pycraft will be located at the releases page (Thats all versions), and the previous section on the home-page with branches will change. The default branch will be the most recent release, then there will be branches for all the sub-releases to Pycraft there too; and the sister program; Pycraft-Insider-Preview will be deprecated and all data moved to relevant places in this repository, this should hopefully cut down on the confusion and make the project more user-friendly.

## Other Sources
We now post a roughly monthly article about Pycraft, showing behind the scenes, tips and tricks and additional information, this is shared to both Medium (medium.com/@PycraftDev) and Dev (dev.to/PycraftDev) and builds on the regular posts we share to Twitter (twitter.com/PycraftDev) and Dev (dev.to/PycraftDev).

## Final Notices
Thank you greatly for supporting this project simply by running it, we are sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes. The program will be updated frequently and we shall do my best to keep this up to date too. we also want to add that you are welcome to view and change the program and share it with your friends however please may we have some credit, just a name would do and if you find any bugs or errors, please feel free to comment in the comments section any feedback so we can improve my program, it will all be much appreciated and give as much detail as you wish to give out.
