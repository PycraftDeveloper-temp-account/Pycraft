## About
Pycraft is a 3D open-source, open-world video game made in Python. For a long time attempts to make large 3D games in Python have been ignored, we believe there are two reasons: one; People use Python primarily for data handling and processing and not graphics and, two; there is little to no documentation out there to do anything more than make a 3D rotating cube in Python. Making a 3D game in Python for us hasn't been an easy experience, far from it but we have decided to share my project, complete with tutorials, explanations, articles and code explanations in the hope that 3D game development in Python can be seen as a more easily attainable target, and to fill that gap in documentation. Pycraft then is a trial project, as we learn and experiment on what goes best where and how thing go together, this is why development can sometimes appear to have stopped, because we are learning and testing what we have learned, so hopefully for people in the future it will be an easier experience. Also, don't forget there is more to game development than just graphics, there is AI, sound, physics and all the other GUIs that go with it, and as we learn the quality of the overall program will improve. Pycraft is not going to be the final name of the game, however until something better becomes available, we shall stick to it.

## Setup
### Installing the project (recommended)
The way to install Pycraft is changing. For the best experience, we recommend this installation approach:

1. Navigate to the most recent release of Pycraft in the [releases section](https://github.com/PycraftDeveloper/Pycraft/releases)

## Running The Program
When running the program, you will either have a (.exe) file, downloaded from the releases page, or you will have the developer preview, if you have the developer preview, which can be found in the files section of this repository then this is how you run that program.

Now you have the program properly installed hopefully (you'll find out if you haven't promptly!) you need to locate and run the file "main.py" if it crashes on your first run then chances are you haven't installed the program correctly, if it still doesn't work then you can contact us. We do hope however that it works alright for you and you have a pleasant experience. This program has been developed on a Windows 64-bit computer however should run fine on a 32-bit Windows machine (uncompiled) or through MacOS although they remain untested for now.

We recommend creating a shortcut for the "main.py" file too so it's easier to locate.

## Uncompiled Pycraft Dependencies
When you're installing the uncompiled Pycraft variant from here you need to install the following 'modules', which can be done through your Control Panel in Windows (First; press <windows key + r> then type "cmd" then run the below syntax) or on Apple systems in Terminal.

```
pip install <module>
pip uninstall <module>
```
pip is usually installed by default when installing Python with most versions.

- PIL (Pillow or Python Imaging Library) @ www.github.com/python-pillow/Pillow <br />
- Pygame @ www.github.com/pygame/pygame <br />
- Numpy @ www.github.com/numpy/numpy <br />
- PyAutoGUI @ www.github.com/asweigart/pyautogui <br />
- Psutil @ www.github.com/giampaolo/psutil <br />
- PyWaveFront @ www.github.com/pywavefront/PyWavefront <br />
- Py-CPUinfo @ www.github.com/pytorch/cpuinfo <br />
- GPUtil @ www.github.com/anderskm/gputil <br />
- Tabulate @ www.github.com/p-ranav/tabulate <br />
- Moderngl @ www.github.com/moderngl/moderngl <br />

- PyJoystick @ www.github.com/justengel/pyjoystick <br />
- Matplotlib @ www.github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib <br />

_Disclaimer; unfortunately, lots of these python modules (first and third party) can require some external modules that will be installed during the installing process of the above modules, unfortunately this makes it really difficult to give credit to those modules, if you have any recommendations, please contact me appropriately._

## Understanding the release notes
This section will hopefully provide additional information on helping to read the release notes.
* Points detailed after the "Feature" tag are what was focused on in the update and will likely always be present in each update, often this is the most significant area of the update.
* Points detailed after the "Bug-Fix" tag are likely to be the most frequent, they outline the most major bugs that have been fixed in this update, although they are not the only bugs that have been fixed.
* Points detailed after the "Performance" tag are used where there have been significant performance improvements to the project.
* Points detailed after the "Identified-Bugs" tag are bugs that have been identified in the project and that haven't been fixed as of writing the release notes, these are significant issues and will be fixed as soon as possible.
* Points detailed after the final "Documentation" tag are indicators of significant improvements to the documentation. The "PEP8" tag is used to signify that significant changes have been made to Pycraft to bring it in line with the PEP8 standards.

## Input mapping
This section will be replaced with a dedicated file for key-mapping as well as an in-game guide when this area of Pycraft is completed.
### Keyboard

* Use W, A, S, D in game to move around.
* Use SPACE to jump in game or to control the camera spin in the 2D engine.
* Use F11 to toggle full-screen
* Use L in game to toggle locking your mouse (forcing it to stay in the window or not)

_A detailed map of inputs for keyboard and mouse or controller combinations is coming; for now, see the section below, toggling between full-screen is currently not bound to a button on the controller because we will need all the different buttons for gameplay_

## Our Update Policy
New releases will be introduced regularly, it is likely that there will be some form of error or bug, therefore unless you intend to use this project for development and feedback purposes (Thank you all!) we recommend you use the latest stable release; below is how to identify the stable releases.

## Version Naming
Pycraft's versions will always now follow the structure; "vA.B.C"
* Where "A" is the major revision number.
* Where "B" is the minor revision number.
* Where "C" is the patch and developer preview numbers (combined).

Every version of Pycraft as of the 27/10/2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) must feature all 3 values. Updates also now go sequentially, so Pycraft v9.6.4 is newer than Pycraft v9.5.7. If either of the "A" or "B" version numbers is incremented in a release, documentation MUST be suitably updated, in addition Pycraft MUST be released on PyPi, SourceForge and as a release on GitHub.

## Releases
All past versions of Pycraft are available under the releases section of Pycraft, this is a new change, but just as before, major releases like Pycraft v0.9 and Pycraft v0.8 will have (.exe) releases, but smaller sub-releases will not, this is in light of a change coming to Pycraft, this should help with the confusion behind releases, and be more accommodating to the installer that's being worked on as a part of Pycraft v0.9.4. This brings me on to another point, all past updates to Pycraft will be located at the releases page (Thats all versions), and the previous section on the home-page with branches will change. The default branch will be the most recent release, then there will be branches for all the sub-releases to Pycraft there too; and the sister program; Pycraft-Insider-Preview will be deprecated and all data moved to relevant places in this repository, this should hopefully cut down on the confusion and make the project more user-friendly.

## Other Sources
We now post a roughly monthly article about Pycraft, showing behind the scenes, tips and tricks and additional information, this is shared to both Medium (medium.com/@PycraftDev) and Dev (dev.to/PycraftDev) and builds on the regular posts we share to Twitter (twitter.com/PycraftDev) and Dev (dev.to/PycraftDev).

## Final Notices
Thank you greatly for supporting this project simply by running it, we are sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes. The program will be updated frequently and we shall do my best to keep this up to date too. we also want to add that you are welcome to view and change the program and share it with your friends however please may we have some credit, just a name would do and if you find any bugs or errors, please feel free to comment in the comments section any feedback so we can improve my program, it will all be much appreciated and give as much detail as you wish to give out.
