Pycraft is an OpenGL, OpenWorld, Video Game made entirely with Python. This project is a test to shed some light on OpenGL programming in Python as it is a seldom touched area of Python's vast amount of uses. Feel free to give this project a run, and message me if you have any feedback! <br />
Made with Python 64-bit and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

## Update Timeline
Pycraft will be continually updated for a long time yet. The next few releases, Pycraft v0.9.x will not feature as a (.exe) release but only as a code release. Pycraft will now updated gradually, not all in one go, however (.exe) releases will likely only occur at major releases like the upcoming Pycraft v0.10! The following plan was taken from my Medium article: How We are Making a Video Game in Python #2 (here: https://medium.com/@PycraftDev/how-we-are-making-a-video-game-in-python-2-547b504bbd67) <br />

At present this is the schedule for Pycraft updates: <br />

*Current*

* Pycraft v0.9.5 - This update aims to add weather into Pycraft, including sunny, light rain, heavy rain and storms, each with varying probabilities. In addition to this, this update will also include Perlin noise-based cloud generation, rain particles and general improvements to Pycraft's current sound design by adding in thunder sound effects and rain sound effects with better audio and volume control. This update will be also adding in a lightning effect and is the first update to include particle effects.

*Near Future*

* Pycraft v0.9.6 - In light of the improvements and advances to the game engine we are interrupting the regular update schedule to improve the settings menu and benchmark menu. The benchmark menu is being modified as its purpose has changed and its results are inaccurate with a dated design. The settings menu is also getting changed, featuring a more efficient as well as structured approach and layout, with different menus determining different categories of settings, for example graphics and sound would be different menus. The settings menu is also being updated to bring it more in-line with other in-game settings menu's, improving accessibility as well as allowing more customisation of your in-game experience. This update will also introduce the idea of save files into Pycraft as well as deciding which saved game to play. You will have two save files and three autosave files which will save your progress in game.

*Currently not set in stone*

* Pycraft v0.9.7 - *This update may be rolled into Pycraft v0.9.6 or v0.9.8 and will introduce the idea of a HUD into Pycraft.

* Pycraft v0.9.8 - This update will introduce the concept of water into Pycraft, possibly including reflections, better shadow mapping and better in game movement.

* Pycraft v0.9.9 - This update will start to improve the in-game world, introducing objects like houses, trees, better scaling etc.

* Pycraft v0.9.10 - This update will introduce the idea of entities (animals and hostiles) into Pycraft as well as the introduction of items that can be picked up and interacted with.

* Pycraft v0.9.11 - This update will significantly improve the inventory GUI
